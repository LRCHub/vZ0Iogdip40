Baby girl you got a hold on me
Oh sugar
I got a soft spot for you baby ooh
Wonder what it is you got
Makes me think you so hot
A soft spot for you baby ooh
There's nothing you could do
To make me stop loving you

In sunshine or sorrow
Still I know tomorrow
In blue skies or rain
I'll keep on falling again and again
For you oooooooh it's true baby
Something you've got gets me in my soft spot
I got a soft spot for you baby
And I've got to make you mine

Baby girl you got a hold on me
Oh sugar

I got a soft spot for you baby ooh
There's nothing you could do
To make me stop loving you
A soft spot for you baby ooh
Wonder what it is you got
Makes me think you so hot

Ooooh it's true baby
Something you got gets me in my soft spot
I got a soft spot for you baby
And I've got to make you mine
Said I've got to make you mine, girl
Something you got
Something you got
That gets me right there in my soft spot
And I've got to make you mine
