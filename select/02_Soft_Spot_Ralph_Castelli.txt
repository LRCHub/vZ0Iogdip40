I don't wanna be everything you need
I don't wanna be everything you need

Same place goes off
In my head the lights don't come on
I'm too tired to not care about all the things you need
The feelings are gone
The stupid little games got me lost
You can count me out of this one
'Coz I don't want to be

I don't wanna be everything you need
I don't wanna be everything you need

You know I've got a soft spot but it's hard to find
I know you think you found one but it's not mine
And now the feelings are gone
The stupid little games got me lost
You can count me out of this one
'Coz I don't want to be

I don't wanna be everything you need
I don't wanna be everything you need

You know I got a soft spot
You know I got a soft spot
You know I got a soft spot
You know I got a soft spot

I don't wanna be everything you need
I don't wanna be everything you need
