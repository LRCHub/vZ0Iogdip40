I can try not to, but I still care about you
It's an addiction that I can't find the cure to
And all my friends say I should let go
But I'm still looking for the antidote
And when you come up my heart skips a beat
I hide my love trying to show defeat

Ooh, you make me crazy
My thoughts running through me, arguing with me
Ooh, my heads lost this battle, my heart takes the wheel
Cause I know how I feel

I got a soft spot for you
I got a weakness for you
Tell me, what should I do?
When I still want you

I can try not to, but I still want to need you
Don't know what it is, that makes me so drawn to you
And I don't waste time on second chances
But with you I forget my mantras
The truth is that I want here beside me
To feel again all that electricity

Ooh, you make me crazy
My thoughts running through me, arguing with me
Ooh, my heads lost this battle, my heart takes the wheel
Cause I know how I feel

I got a soft spot for you
I got a weakness for you
Tell me, what should I do?
When I still want you
