I don't go out
but I'll do it for you
You never liked it
when I drank too much
I hate to dance
but I'll dance with you
'Cause I'd do anything
to feel your touch
Don't like anybody, tell me why
it's different with you
Don't believe in love but
no one makes me feel like you do
I don't say it much
'cause I just always thought
that you knew, oh
It's what you do to me
I'm wrapped around your finger
and it can't stop
You know
I got a soft spot for you
You know
I got a soft spot for you
Baby, can't you see
I need you 'cause you're
everything that I want and more
You know
I got a soft spot for you
You know
I got a soft spot for you
Too late, don't wanna fall, baby
I just don't need somebody else
to throw me aside
But I'm up all night
Thinking 'bout how it could be
you to change my heart, but I
Don't like anybody, tell me why
it's different with you
Don't believe in love but
no one makes me feel like you do
I don't say it much
'cause I just always thought
that you knew, oh
It's what you do to me
I'm wrapped around your finger
and it can't stop
You know
I got a soft spot for you
You know
I got a soft spot for you
Baby, can't you see
I need you 'cause you're
everything that I want and more
You know
I got a soft spot for you
You know
I got a soft spot for you
For you
For you, for you
For you
You know
I got a soft spot for you
It's what you do to me
I'm wrapped around your finger
and it can't stop
You know
I got a soft spot for you
You know
I got a soft spot for you
